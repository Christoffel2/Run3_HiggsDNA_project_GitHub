# Run3_HiggsDNA_project_GitHub
This GitHub repository stores the 2022 preEE and postEE data and signal & background MC samples, HiggsDNA processor (VHtoLeptonicGGProcessor) and some python scripts that are related to my Master analysis. The operational instruction of HiggsDNA written by me is also included.

Detector: The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) at CERN LHC

Target process: WH-leptonic process
